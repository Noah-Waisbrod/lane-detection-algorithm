# Lane Detection Algorithm
This project implements a lane detection algorithm that can process dash cam footage and output a video with the lane lines highlighted in blue. The algorithm uses Python and OpenCV to perform image processing techniques such as color filtering, edge detection, region of interest selection, and Hough transform. The algorithm can identify and draw straight lines for the left and right lanes on each frame of the video. The output video shows the original footage with the blue lane lines overlaid on top.
